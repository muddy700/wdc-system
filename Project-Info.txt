<===== Queries =====>

// 1. Is there a need to put all two fields separate(contactPerson and relationshipHolder)
//2. Is there any possibility for WB to finance the same PIU in more than one project?
//3. Receiving Grievances through text, how-does-it-work-with-system?
//4. A summary of grievances per sub-project (can be public or private);
//5. It should be able to store interactions (questions raised and answers provided & by whom);
  -Should be text-written or summarized in pdf and upload a pdf file with all interactions
  - (b-coz fetching them in the system as they occur it's very rare)
//6. Is there any possibility for a project to have more than one contractor?

# 1. add relationshipHolder
# 2. add project phase
